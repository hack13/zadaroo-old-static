										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a fact that people do not live forever, and things on the internet can happen from time to time. As the new widespread adoption of IPFS(A Decentralized Web Infrastructure), I have decided to put a copy of Zadaroo&#8217;sÂ assets on there, so that everyone can download and help host a copy of Zadaroo&#8217;sÂ assets as well as let it continue to be online even in the event of Zadaroo&#8217;sÂ death or even my own. The files will always exist on the distributed network known as IPFS.</p>
<p>You can access the files on IPFS at <a href="https://onipfs.zadaroo.com/">https://onipfs.zadaroo.com/</a> or by using any gateway with Zadaroo&#8217;s hash QmTKZFnKjXvbPcygiRhJxhfvTcpFnSr5VWrnzzmzpfFoae where you can use any public or private gateway.</p>
<p><strong>Popular Gateways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTKZFnKjXvbPcygiRhJxhfvTcpFnSr5VWrnzzmzpfFoae">https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTKZFnKjXvbPcygiRhJxhfvTcpFnSr5VWrnzzmzpfFoae</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmTKZFnKjXvbPcygiRhJxhfvTcpFnSr5VWrnzzmzpfFoae">https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmTKZFnKjXvbPcygiRhJxhfvTcpFnSr5VWrnzzmzpfFoae</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, a big thank you to everyone has donated. I have moved hosts to putting this on a VPS and the files hosted in object storage with OVH&#8217;s Object Storage and CloudFlare as a CDN to help cache as much of the objects as possible for better download speeds. All donations that are received go into keeping the site hosted which at this point is a little less than 90/year and I am happy to keep covering what donations don&#8217;t because I am not asking for the donations just if you want to help me keep this site up for those who still find these resources for everyone to still download.</p>
<p>Thank you and everyone have a great New Year!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zetamex has decided to officially stop funding Zadaroo. This was a decision that was not taken lightly by those at Zetamex, this was done after a considerable debate. Since the entire content of this site is licensed as Public Domain, the choice to make Zadaroo it&#8217;s own site and hosted by itself and not be a part of Zetamex anymore. The site is now setup as a static site, for all the metaverse to use without charge or any sort of cost to its visitors. This site will receive no new content nor updates, except those that patch the server running it and the software used to render the site. The site will not be going offline, and will not be accepting donations at this time, and it is up for debate if it will open donations back up or not. All content has been moved to it&#8217;s own CDN as well not hosted or sponsored by Zetamex in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>Thank You, for the many years of support for, the ever lasting and continuing to help content for both education and hobbyists everywhere. The site will continue to function and be privately operated from this point on, for the greater good of the Metaverse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I want to touch on the subject of using Imprudence in OpenSimulator as of now, and I hate to bring this up to people but it is obsolete. I know that they have recently released a new beta of the viewer but it still lacks three big features that are in the 0.7.6 and some from the current stable 0.7.5 branch of OpenSimulator. We highly encurage users to consider using an alternative viewer to upload their creations to make sure their viewer can support the new features of opensimulator.</p>
<h3>Features that Imprudence Does NOT Support</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jump more than 4096 regions away</li>
<li>Mesh uploads</li>
<li>Viewing Mesh (shows up as weird triangles)</li>
<li>Multiple Attachments on a point</li>
<li>Inability to see users using multiple attachments on the same point properly</li>
<li>Build tools outdated</li>
</ul>
<h3>We highly recommend these two viewers for importing XML files. They both are v1 style like imprudence, but have all the new features that are needed to view worlds correctly:</h3>
<p><strong>Cool VL Viewer:</strong> This viewer is extremely light and super fast, however is only for Linux and Windows. You can download the viewer from:Â <a href="http://sldev.free.fr/" target="_blank">http://sldev.free.fr/</a></p>
<p><strong>Singularity Viewer:</strong> Â This viewer is closely worked with opensimulator and is worked on almost daily, this viewer is cross platform and can be made to look like imprudence. You can download it from <a href="http://singularityviewer.org/" target="_blank">http://singularityviewer.org/</a></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zetamex Staff</p>
